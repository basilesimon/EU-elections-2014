#EU-elections-2014

Unnecessary exploration of the 2014 European election in the UK.

####To-do
######Basile le Simon
- [ ] Second pie chart for media coverage
    - [ ] Formulate queries for number of occurrences (since 2 weeks since campaign start)
- [ ] Fix colour-coding of pie-charts
- [ ] Graph of candidates' number of occurrences over time
- [ ] Model dashboard
- [ ] Infos we want to return for candidates from DBPedia

######Iain Herr Collins
- [ ] Tell le Basile how to get the number of occurrences for a concept
- [ ] Have a nice map... that actually gives results
    - [x] Use unique IDs for European constituencies
    - [ ] Separate SVG data in another doc to make ```map.html``` easier to work on?
- Articles map:
    - [x] Clicks display articles
- Candidates map:
    - [ ] Clicks must display a list of the candidates
    - [ ] Clicking on a candidate must display infos about him
        - [ ] Which infos do we want to use? See Basile


####Ideas
- Dashboard to follow the elections
- Highlight the different media coverages the parties and candidates receive
- Find patterns in the data
- Provide background info *after* the election
    - Enter your postcode and find out more about your elected MEP
